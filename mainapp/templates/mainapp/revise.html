		<p>Ensure your model is fully packaged as a <code>.glb</code> file before uploading, meaning it should include all textures and resources embedded within the file.</p>
		<p>Also, make sure the file size is less than {{ max_model_size }} MB and that the glTF binary is a valid model and not empty.</p>
